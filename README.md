# Shifts Logger

The [Shifts Logger](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/17/shifts-logger) project is the first project I've done that created an API and also a console app to consume it. This project is part of [The C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/) curriculum.

## Requirements

- [x] This is an application where you should record a worker's shifts.
- [x] You need to create two applications: the Web API and the UI that will call it.
- [x] All validation and user input should happen in the UI app.
- [x] Your API's controller should be lean. Any logic should be handled in a separate "service".
- [x] You should use SQL Server, not SQLite.
- [x] You should use the "code first" approach to create your database, using Entity Framework's migrations tool.
- [x] Your front-end project needs to have try-catch blocks around the API calls so it handles unexpected errors (e.g. the API isn't running or returns a 500 error.)
